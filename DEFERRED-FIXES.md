# Deferred fixes: 2026-08-09 manuscript sync

Running log of errors, corrections and open questions found while working the
six-step sync. **Nothing here gets fixed until steps 1 to 6 are done.** Add to it
as each step turns things up; work it after step 6.

Sync steps: 1 unarmed rewrite (done, `2ede818`), 2 renames and gear values (done,
`70f66b8`), 3 Triage Save DC and Stitcher class data, 4 Trauma Rig, 5 Armor Repair,
6 Environmental Hazards.

## Needs an author ruling (blocked on Brandon, not on code)

- **`Zeroed In` versus `Dead-Eye Sniper`.** The handoff's printed order for Combat &
  Weapon Mastery ends with `Zeroed In` and omits `Dead-Eye Sniper`, which currently
  occupies position 6. `Zeroed In` does not exist anywhere in the app. That reads as
  an unlisted rename, but the same handoff says the Deadeye naming is deliberately
  unresolved. **That category is currently unreordered.** Is `Dead-Eye Sniper`
  becoming `Zeroed In`?
- **Pneumatic Bypass has nowhere to live.** Classified as a +1 unarmed increaser, but
  it is a Ripper Hot-Wire a Stitcher installs on an *ally*, and the character record
  has no field for "an ally augmented me." Recorded as a comment in `engine.js`,
  implemented as nothing. Needs a manual toggle on the sheet if it should be live.
- **Juggernaut step-up on a wielded body.** The Walking Anvil steps improvised
  weapons up one die, and a wielded body is explicitly a Heavy improvised weapon.
  Not applied, since that text lives in a separate block.
- **Should the damage tray learn flat-only totals?** The base unarmed strike is a
  flat 1 plus Body Modifier, and the tray is dice-driven, so the base strike opens no
  tray. Riders are also not preloaded into it; Shock Gloves is the one unconditional
  rider that could be.
- **14 PART C rulings** still outstanding from earlier sessions.

## Confirmed defects, unfixed

- **Pneumatic Bypass prose is a fifth stale unarmed string.**
  `app/data/class_stitcher_resources.js` (two copies) still reads "Their unarmed
  strikes deal 1d6 Bludgeoning damage", which is replacer wording, while
  `engine.js` classifies it as an increase. Same class as the four fixed in
  `70f66b8`; left alone only because it was not on the handoff's list.
- **One pre-existing weapon-proficiency orphan**, a Signature Weapon, found while
  checking the category table. Confirmed identical in `HEAD`, so no change caused it.
- **Seven unread review findings** from the unarmed rewrite, in
  `tasks/wgxtatdtw.output`: five from the reclassification lens, two from the UI
  lens. Read these before touching unarmed code again. The one that was read (Parry
  pulling a phantom die from dieless gear) is fixed in `70f66b8`.
- **Two unread review findings** from the renames pass, in `tasks/w2e5slhtt.output`,
  beyond the two that were read and resolved.

## Unverified rendering paths (logic verified, screen not seen)

- **Codex Improvised Damage step-up** for a Juggernaut. The panel is collapsed by
  default and could not be opened programmatically. Ladder math and no-throw
  confirmed; the stepped dice were never seen rendered.

## Handoff items that turned out to be no-ops in the app

Recorded so nobody re-investigates them.

- **The Signature Weapons proficiency row never existed here.**
  `EN.rules.gear.weapons` already held exactly the eight categories, and all three
  `GROUP_CAT` maps already matched.
- **`Insulation Bypass` does not exist in the app**, so its rewording has no site.
- **Advanced Medkit Edge lines have no app site.** No Treat Wounds mechanic entry and
  no Treat Fatigue severity table; the medkit items already carry the new semantics.
- **`Resonant Fatigue` had one app site, not two.** The second lives in the legacy
  single-file prototype, which is gitignored and superseded by `app/`.
- **The `Not on My Watch` death-rules cross-reference has no app site.** The app
  carries no death chapter naming the capstone.

## Author review wanted on data I generated

- **`TALENT_UNARMED_STEP`, `CYBER_UNARMED`, `GEAR_UNARMED_STEP` and
  `GEAR_UNARMED_RIDER` in `engine.js`.** These encode which talents, chrome and gear
  set or step unarmed damage, at which tier. Scope went past what was specified, so
  the classifications deserve a read.

## Latent issue found in step 3

- **The action-type classifier cannot see bolded action types.** It is a plain-text
  regex (`app/js/combat.js` around line 1230, duplicated in `app/js/printsheet.js`
  and `app/js/pdfexport.js`) matching `as an Action`, so any feature written
  `As an **Action**` falls through and renders as PASSIVE on the sheet, the print
  sheet and the PDF. Step 3 tripped this twice and was fixed by unbolding those two
  strings, which is the convention that already worked. But `Rig Fuel`,
  `Biological Meltdown` and `Chemical Warfare` are mis-tagged PASSIVE for the same
  reason, and that predates this sync. Widening the regex to tolerate `**` would fix
  all of them at once, but it reclassifies features beyond the sync's scope, so it
  was left alone. Worth doing deliberately later.
- **`Field Triage` moved from Features to Abilities** because the Beacon Rig toggle
  introduced "Free Action" into its text. Correct for a feature that now has an
  active toggle, but it is a visible relocation.
- **"Triage Rig" versus "Trauma Rig" naming.** The tier table exports as
  `EN.traumaRigs` while the class prose still says Triage Rig. Settle in step 4.
- **"The modifier this Talent raised" is not derivable.** Talent attribute increases
  are not modeled at all, so the app never learns whether the player raised Wits or
  Tech on Trauma Medic. The text carries a parenthetical instead. Deriving it needs a
  new stored choice on the talent.
- **Cyber-Scrap capacity is prose only.** Nothing computes it, so the Chop Rig
  doubling to twice Tech Modifier is text with no engine path behind it.

## Environment

- **Parts 2 and 3 are not spilled in full.** Chrome refuses downloads from
  `docs.google.com`, so only Part 1 is on disk (`ms/part1.md`). Targeted extracts of
  the changed passages are at `ms/targeted-2026-08-04.md`. Unblock by allowing
  automatic downloads for that origin.
